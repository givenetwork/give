        <p>GIVE enables donors to give recurring amounts that work with their budget and easily allocate it to thousands of people as microdonations.
        GIVE enables donation recipients an easy way to predict and manage their inflow of microdonations several months in advance.
        GIVE enables anyone with an opinion to publish how they believe these microdonations should be allocated and let donors subscribe to it.
        GIVE provides the data graph so we can all collectively see how the global community is allocating all of its donations collectively.</p>

        <p>GIVE is about investing in the future we want to see by directly supporting those people we believe in to make it happen.
        GIVE is designed to enable the community to collectively manage its community donations in a self-directing method.</p>

        <p>GIVE donors remain in control of their donations at all times, and are aided in building their donation portfolios by importing data from "channels" defined around the internet.</p>

        <p>Oftentimes as a donor, you don't know who the right people to give to are, how much to give them, or can't decide between many worthy places.
        Sometimes you feel like the amount you have to donate simply isn't enough to make a difference, or where your donation might make the most impact.</p>

        <p>As a recipient of donations, you're oftentimes on the recurring cycle of: run a campaign to load up the coffers, use up the coffers, start over with the next campaign.  Getting regular, reliable, recurring donations can seem difficult.
        As a recipient you may oftentimes have very little visibility into what kind of flows you have coming in down the road.</p>

        <p>As a community, the lack of high level aggregate information makes it hard for us to see what areas of our community are being starved while others may have more than they can immediately make use of.</p>

        <p>GIVE is designed to be a system that enables everyone to keep their independence but at the same time coordinate their donations with others to ensure the areas of the community that are most meaningful to them get supported.</p>

        <p>In GIVE, a donor sets their recurring donation level at whatever works for their budget, and then separately those donations are divided up as a microallocations over many people and distributed out over time in daily microdeliveries.</p>

        <p>A donor makes a single, larger donation into the GIVE system and specifies over how many days that donation should last.
        Each day, the system takes a daily donation amount and distributes it out according to the instructions supplied by the donor's current donation portfolio.</p>

        <p>People around the Internet, project leaders, community leaders, journalists, users, or simply anyone or any program with an opinion on where the best places to send our donations are, publishes them for donors to subscribe to.
        They turn their opinions into "Published Channels", and these channels are what donors import into their portfolio to help them allocate their donations.</p>

        <p>The GIVE system takes care of helping the donors build their portfolios, import the channels, and compute the daily delivery amounts and microallocations to all the specified recipients.</p>

        <p>Lastly, the GIVE system assembles all the allocation data, computing a community donation allocation graph so we can see everywhere our donations are going to end up, enabling us to visualize it and make adjustments as we individually see fit.</p>
